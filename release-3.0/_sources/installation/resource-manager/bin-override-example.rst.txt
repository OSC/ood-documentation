.. _bin-overrides:

A Working Example of a ``bin_overrides`` Script
===============================================

``sbatch`` is the Slurm scheduler's submission client. In this example we will show how cluster configuration's ``bin_overrides`` may be used to change default behavior.

This example demonstrates a few uses of wrapping the default scheduler clients:

* Using SSH from the web host to launch ``sbatch`` on the submit host
* Altering arguments passed to the scheduler
* Altering the script passed to ``sbatch`` (which is almost certainly a terrible idea)
* Logging values passed to the scheduler in a custom location (note that the values passed to ``sbatch`` are also logged to the PUN log file at ``/var/log/ondemand-nginx/$USER/error.log`` by the Dashboard and Job Composer when submitting jobs)

.. warning::

    This wrapper when used with the OOD Job Composer will place any ``stdout`` or ``stderr`` files in ``$HOME`` instead of the usual location of ``$HOME/ondemand/data/sys/myjobs/projects/default/$JOBID``.

  An example of a `bin_overrides` replacing Slurm `sbatch` for use with Open OnDemand.

  Requirements:

  - $USER must be able to SSH from web node to submit node without using a password

  Examples:

  - SSH's from a web node to a submit node
  - Logging values passed to sbatch
  - Altering arguments passed to sbatch
  - Altering the script passed to sbatch (which is almost certainly a bad idea)

  Thoughts for further development:

  - Add out of script configuration (SUBMISSION_NODE, logging preferences)
  - Improve logging permission handling (right now it needs to be done manually)
  - Solve problem of CWD being set to the $HOME

  Note that as of v1.4.9 OOD's job adapters parse stdout but may not validate;
  changing the format of sbatch's stdout can break applications. For exit codes
  OOD's job adapters require that the wrapper exit 0 on success and non 0 on
  failure.
