Install Other Interactive Apps
==============================

For Jupyter, we provide a tutorial for copying a generic Jupyter batch connect
template and modifying it to work at your center. See
:ref:`app-development-tutorials-interactive-apps-add-jupyter` to install
Jupyter.

If you have developed an app and would like to contribute it to the community, please post a description and link to the app to https://discourse.osc.edu/c/open-ondemand.
In order to submit the code of an interactive app that you developed to the GitHub repository, it should be available on the developerâ€™s GitHub and well commented. The comments need to include, but not limited to, mentioning if there are parts of the app that are site-specific. Also, the following files must be included:

- LICENSE file - the license should be open source. If you are not sure what to choose, OnDemand uses MIT License.

- README.md file - which specifies all the dependencies as well as cluster specific instructions
