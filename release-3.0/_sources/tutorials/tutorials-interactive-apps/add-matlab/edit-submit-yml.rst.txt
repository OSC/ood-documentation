Modify Submit Parameters
========================

In some cases the MATLAB app batch job fails to submit to the given cluster or
you are not happy with the default chosen submission parameters. This section
explains how to modify the submission parameters.

The main responsibility of the ``submit.yml.erb`` file
(:ref:`app-development-interactive-submit`) located in the root of the app is
for modifying the underlying batch script that is generated from an internal
template and its submission parameters.

.. note::

   The ``.erb`` file extension will cause the YAML configuration file to be
   processed using the `eRuby (Embedded Ruby)`_ templating system. This allows
   you to embed Ruby code into the YAML configuration file for flow control,
   variable substitution, validation, and more.

The simplest ``submit.yml.erb`` will look like:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # ~/ondemand/dev/bc_my_center_matlab/submit.yml.erb
   ---
   batch_connect:
     template: "vnc"

Which only describes which internal template to use when generating the batch
script. From here we can add more options to the batch script, such as:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 5

   # ~/ondemand/dev/bc_my_center_matlab/submit.yml.erb
   ---
   batch_connect:
     template: "vnc"
     set_host: "host=$(hostname -A | awk '{print $2}')"

where we override the :command:`bash` script used to determine the host name of
the compute node from within a running batch job.

You can learn more about possible ``batch_connect`` options here:

http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/ood_core/OodCore%2FBatchConnect%2FTemplate:initialize

.. warning::

   It is recommended any global ``batch_connect`` attributes be defined in the
   corresponding cluster configuration file under::

     /etc/ood/config/clusters.d/my_cluster.yml

   There is further discussion on this under
   :ref:`app-development-interactive-setup-modify-cluster-configuration`.

But in most cases you will want to change the actual job submission parameters
(e.g., node type). These are defined under the ``script`` option as:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 5-

   # ~/ondemand/dev/bc_my_center_matlab/submit.yml.erb
   ---
   batch_connect:
     template: "vnc"
   script:
     ...

You can read more about all the available ``script`` options here:

http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/ood_core/OodCore/Job/Script

Although in most cases you will want to modify the ``native`` attribute, which
is resource manager dependent. Some examples are given below.

.. note::

   It is recommended you commit the changes you made to ``submit.yml.erb`` to
   `git`_.

   .. code-block:: sh

      git commit submit.yml.erb -m 'updated batch job options'

Slurm
-----

For Slurm, you can choose the features on a requested node with:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 5-

   # ~/ondemand/dev/bc_my_center_matlab/submit.yml.erb
   ---
   batch_connect:
     template: "vnc"
   script:
     native:
       - "-N"
       - "<%= bc_num_slots.blank? ? 1 : bc_num_slots.to_i %>"
       - "-C"
       - "c12"

where we define the :command:`sbatch` parameters as an array under ``script``
and ``native``.

.. note::

   The ``native`` attribute is an array of command line arguments. So the above
   example is equivalent to appending to :command:`sbatch`:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sbatch ... -N <bc_num_slots> -C c12

   The ``bc_num_slots`` shown above located within the ERB syntax is the value
   returned from web form for "Number of nodes". We check if it is blank and
   return a valid number (since it wouldn't make sense to return ``0``).

Torque
------

For Torque, you can choose processors-per-node with:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 5-

   # ~/ondemand/dev/bc_my_center_matlab/submit.yml.erb
   ---
   batch_connect:
     template: "vnc"
   script:
     native:
       resources:
         nodes: "<%= bc_num_slots.blank? ? 1 : bc_num_slots.to_i %>:ppn=28"

.. note::

   See http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/pbs/PBS%2FBatch:submit_script for more
   information on possible values for the ``native`` attribute.

   The ``bc_num_slots`` shown above located within the ERB syntax is the value
   returned from web form for "Number of nodes". We check if it is blank and
   return a valid number (since it wouldn't make sense to return ``0``).

PBS Professional
----------------

For most cases of PBS Professional you will want to modify how the
``bc_num_slots`` (number of CPUs on a single node) is submitted to the batch
server.

This can be specified as such:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 5-

   # ~/ondemand/dev/bc_my_center_matlab/submit.yml.erb
   ---
   batch_connect:
     template: "vnc"
   script:
     native:
       - "-l"
       - "select=1:ncpus=<%= bc_num_slots.blank? ? 1 : bc_num_slots.to_i %>"

where we define the :command:`qsub` parameters as an array under ``script`` and
``native``.

If you would like to mimic how Torque handles ``bc_num_slots`` (number of
**nodes**), then we will first need to change the form label of
``bc_num_slots`` that the user sees in the form. This can be done by adding to
the form configuration file the highlighted lines:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 7-8

   # ~/ondemand/dev/bc_my_center_matlab/form.yml
   ---
   cluster: "cluster1"
   attributes:
     modules: "python"
     extra_jupyter_args: ""
     bc_num_slots:
       label: "Number of nodes"
   form:
     - modules
     - extra_jupyter_args
     - bc_num_hours
     - bc_num_slots
     - bc_account
     - bc_queue
     - bc_email_on_started

Now when we click *Launch Jupyter Notebook* from the app details view, the form
in the browser will have the new label "Number of nodes" instead of "Number of
CPUs on a single node".

Next we will need to handle how we submit the ``bc_num_slots`` since it means
something different now. So we modify the job submission configuration file as
such:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 5-

   # ~/ondemand/dev/bc_my_center_matlab/submit.yml.erb
   ---
   batch_connect:
     template: "vnc"
   script:
     native:
       - "-l"
       - "select=<%= bc_num_slots.blank? ? 1 : bc_num_slots.to_i %>:ncpus=28"

where we replace ``ncpus=28`` with the correct number for your cluster. You can
also append ``mem=...gb`` to the ``select=...`` statement if you'd like.

.. note::

   The ``native`` attribute is an array of command line arguments. So the above
   example is equivalent to appending to :command:`qsub`:

   .. code-block:: sh

      qsub ... -l select=<bc_num_slots>:ncpus=28

   The ``bc_num_slots`` shown above located within the ERB syntax is the value
   returned from web form for "Number of nodes". We check if it is blank and
   return a valid number (since it wouldn't make sense to return ``0``).

Other Resource Manager
----------------------

For most of our other adapters (aside from Torque) the ``native`` attribute is
an array of command line arguments formatted similarly to the
:ref:`app-development-tutorials-interactive-apps-add-jupyter-modify-submit-parameters-slurm`
example above.
