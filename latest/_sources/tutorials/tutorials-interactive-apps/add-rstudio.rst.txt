Add an RStudio App
==================

This tutorial will walk you through creating an interactive RStudio app that
your users will use to launch a `RStudio Server <rstudio_server_>`_ within a batch job
on a compute node. The user will then be able to connect to the running server
through their browser and take advantage of the resources provided within the
batch job.
