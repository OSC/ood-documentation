Developing The OOD Dashboard
============================

.. warning::
    :ref:`enabling-development-mode` must be completed first for this tutorial to work.

Open OnDemand is composed of several apps, one of which is the ``dashboard`` app. 
You can see some of the other apps that make up OOD `here. <https://github.com/OSC/ondemand/tree/master/apps>`__

This tutorial aims to equip admins with the knowledge and tools for developing the Open OnDemand 
``dashboard`` and ``shell`` apps directly from *within* OnDemand itself.
