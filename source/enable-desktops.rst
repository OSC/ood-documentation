Enable Interactive Desktop
==========================

This installation guide will walk you through setting up an Interactive Desktop
app that your users will be able to use to launch a Gnome 2 or Mate desktop on
a compute node within your HPC cluster. The user should then be able to connect
to a running session through their browser using the `noVNC`_ client.

   Confirm that you have walked through the
   :ref:`app-development-interactive-setup` instructions for :ref:`interactive`
   before continuing on.
