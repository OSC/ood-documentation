Vulnerability Management
========================

Introduction
------------

Vulnerability management is a critical component of the security strategy for Open OnDemand. This document outlines the procedures for reporting and managing vulnerabilities.

Reporting a Vulnerability
-------------------------

If you have security concerns or think you have found a vulnerability, please submit a private report by visiting the 'Security' section of our GitHub located at `GitHub Open OnDemand Security <https://github.com/OSC/ondemand/security/>`_ and clicking 'Report a vulnerability'.

For direct inquiries or issues in submitting a report, contact the core project team via email at security@openondemand.org.

Disclosure Policy
-----------------

- Upon reporting, you will receive a response within hours, acknowledging the receipt of the report.
- A primary handler from the team will be assigned to coordinate the fix and release process:
- Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions (1-2 days).
- Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
- Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance and release as soon as possible.

Comments on Policy
------------------

Suggestions to improve this process can be made via submitting a ticket, opening a Discourse topic, or a pull request.

Security Audits
---------------

Open OnDemand has been audited several times by Trusted CI, the NSF Cybersecurity Center of Excellence. The latest engagement report is available `here <https://openondemand.org/sites/default/files/documents/Trusted%20CI%20Open%20OnDemand%20Engagement%20Final%20Report%20-%20REDACTED%20FOR%20PUBLIC%20RELEASE%20210712_0.pdf>`__. These audits have helped shape the security landscape of the platform and contribute to its ongoing security enhancements.

Conclusion
----------

Effective vulnerability management is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of Open OnDemand. Users and contributors play a vital role in this process by reporting potential security vulnerabilities through GitHub, ensuring the platform's continued safety.
