Upgrading from v1.6
-------------------

.. warning::

  If upgrading from OnDemand 1.3.x or older you must upgrade to 1.6.x before upgrading to 1.7.

.. warning::

  As always please update the *development* or *test* instances of OnDemand installed at your center first before you modify the *production* instance.

.. warning::

  Because of a change in Passenger versions and Ruby versions it is necessary that all PUNs running before the upgrade be restarted after the upgrade. It's recommended to schedule an short outage of your OnDemand instance to perform this upgrade.

      sudo yum install -y https://yum.osc.edu/ondemand/1.7/ondemand-release-web-1.7-1.noarch.rpm
