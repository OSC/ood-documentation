Upgrading from v1.7
-------------------

Before upgrading to v1.8, please consider the following:

.. warning:: Shell hosts are now protected behind allowlists.  If you hae not
    explicitly set the default ssh host, you must do so after upgrading. You must
    also update the configuration to allow shell access to any login or compute nodes.
    `See the entry in the release notes for more information. <#shell-hosts-are-now-protected-behind-allowlists>`_


- If upgrading from OnDemand 1.5.x or older **you must upgrade to 1.6.x before upgrading to 1.7**. See directions for upgrading from 1.4 to 1.5 (:ref:`v1.5-release-notes`) and from 1.5 to 1.6 (:ref:`v1.6-release-notes`).
- As always please update the *development* or *test* instances of OnDemand installed at your center first to test and verify before you modify the *production* instance.


#. Update OnDemand release RPM

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum install -y https://yum.osc.edu/ondemand/1.8/ondemand-release-web-1.8-1.noarch.rpm

#. Update OnDemand

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum clean all
      sudo yum update ondemand

#. (Optional) If previously using Apache's Basic Auth, for example with LDAP, it is recommended to switch to :ref:`Dex Authentication <authentication-dex>` by installing the ``ondemand-dex`` package.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum install ondemand-dex

   .. warning::

      The configuration for Dex will need to be made to ``/etc/ood/config/ood_portal.yml`` with your needed LDAP configuration and updates to both Dex and Apache configurations.
      See :ref:`Configuring OnDemand Dex for LDAP <dex-ldap>` for details on configuration of LDAP.


#. Update Apache configuration and restart Apache.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo /opt/ood/ood-portal-generator/sbin/update_ood_portal
      sudo systemctl try-restart httpd24-httpd.service httpd24-htcacheclean.service

#. (Optional) If ``ondemand-dex`` was installed, you must enable and start the ``ondemand-dex`` service.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo systemctl enable ondemand-dex.service
      sudo systemctl start ondemand-dex.service

Upgrading from v1.6
-------------------

Due to changes with ``ood-portal-generator`` it is necessary to run ``update_ood_portal`` with ``--force`` flag
if upgrading from v1.6 of OnDemand to v1.8.


Details
-------

Default authentication is now handled by Dex
............................................

The default authentication mechanism for OnDemand is now using the OIDC provider `Dex`_.  The Dex authentication will replace Apache's Basic Auth.  Sites wishing to continue using LDAP authentication or other forms of Basic Auth are recommended to configure Dex.
See :ref:`Dex Authentication <authentication-dex>` for details on OnDemand Dex.

The data seen in extended view is extracted from the command ``qstat -j -r -xml``.
