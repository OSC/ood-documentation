v2.1 Release Notes
==================

.. warning::

   There are some breaking changes in 2.1. See the upgrade directions below for details.


Highlights in 2.1:

- `Dynamic Javascript in BatchConnect Forms`_
- `Ubuntu 20.04 packages`_
- `Dependency updates`_

Upgrading from v2.0
-------------------

Breaking Changes
................


context.json file locations have changed
****************************************

In versions 2.0 and below, batch connect apps wrote a `context.json` file to
a directory like ``~/data/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/<APPNAME>/context.json``.
OnDemand uses these files to cache the choices a user makes for the next time they
use that app.

Version 2.1 now writes files like ``~/ondemand/data/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/cache/<APPNAME>.json``

When you upgrade, since no files exist in a users cache directory, users will have no
cached settings in any of their batch connect apps.
