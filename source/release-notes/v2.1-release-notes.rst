Upgrading from v2.0
-------------------

Breaking Changes
................

context.json file locations have changed
****************************************

This is an interal item to Open OnDemand and not likely to really affect you at all.

In versions 2.0 and below, batch connect apps wrote a `context.json` file to
a directory like ``~/data/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/<APPNAME>/context.json``.
OnDemand uses these files to cache the choices a user makes for the next time they
use that app.

Version 2.1 now writes files like ``~/ondemand/data/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/cache/<APPNAME>.json``

Deprecations
............

Autoloading during initialization is deprecated.
************************************************

This comes from the Ruby on Rails framework that Open OnDemand utilizes.
It affects initializers you may have written, for example to :ref:`add-shortcuts-to-files-menu`.

To resolve this, wrap your code in a  ``Rails.application.config.after_initialize`` block.

For example, if you have:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # /etc/ood/config/apps/dashboard/initializers/ood.rb

    OodFilesApp.candidate_favorite_paths.tap do |paths|
      # add User project space directory
      paths << FavoritePath.new("/fs/project/#{User.new.name}")
    end

You will need to modify that file like so:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # /etc/ood/config/apps/dashboard/initializers/ood.rb

    Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
      OodFilesApp.candidate_favorite_paths.tap do |paths|
        # add User project space directory
        paths << FavoritePath.new("/fs/project/#{User.new.name}")
      end
    end

Details
-------

EL9, Ubuntu 22.04 and Ubuntu 20.04 packages
...........................................

See :ref:`Install Software <install-software>` for instructions on how to install OnDemand using the new EL9, Ubuntu 22.04 and Ubuntu 20.04 packages.

Dex behind Apache reverse proxy by default
..........................................

  .. warning::

     Dex behind the Apache reverse proxy is a behavior change from OnDemand 2.0 where the reverse proxy configuration was optional.
     This is to improve security as well as allow Apache to provide access logs.
     If you have opened ports for Dex they can be closed as all traffic to Dex will flow through Apache.

By default Dex now sits behind the Apache reverse proxy.
If you wish to go back to Dex being directly accessed set the following in :file:`/etc/ood/config/ood_portal.yml`:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      dex_uri: false

Automatic Form Options
......................

2.1 ships with some ``form.yml`` options that populate forms automatically. This includes
``auto_primary_group``, ``auto_groups``, ``auto_accounts`` and more.

See the section on :ref:`auto-bc-form-options` for all available options.

Support for remote files
........................

2.1 ships with the ability to browse, edit and download remote files from ``rclone``.
Refer to :ref:`remote-file-systems` for how to turn this feature on.

Quick Launch Apps
.................

Quick Launch Apps launch with one click and hard coded settings.  This allows for sites
with common resource requests to hard code those requests into the app such that the
user is never presented with the form.

These launch with 1 click from the user and do not allow for choices. I.e., the user
is never presented with a form to fill out, the app simply launches when clicked.

See the documentation for :ref:`quick-launch-apps` for more information.

Deleting old interactive app directories
........................................

2.1 provides a mechanism to automatically delete all the directories that interactive
applications create in ``~/ondemand/data/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/...`` after some
time period. The system provides two options for this:  One to enable the feature
altogether and the other is to specify how old a directory must be to be removed.

See :ref:`the configuration options for removing old directories <bc_clean_old_dirs>`
for more details.

Disabling interactive app versions
..................................

Sites can now disable showing interactive application versions through the
``hide_app_version`` ondemand.d property.

Dependency updates
..................

This release updates the following dependencies:

- Ruby 3.0

  .. warning:: The change in Ruby version means any Ruby based apps that are not provided by the OnDemand RPM must be rebuilt or supply their own ``bin/ruby`` to use the older version of ruby.

  .. note:: Ruby 2.7 is still supported and used by Ubuntu 20.04.

- NodeJS 14

  .. warning:: The change in Node version means any Node based apps that are not provided by the OnDemand RPM must be rebuilt.

- Passenger 6.0.14
- NGINX 1.20.2
- ondemand-dex 2.32.0
- OnDemand package now depends on Python 3 instead of Python 2

SELinux changes
...............

The ``ondemand_use_shell_app`` SELinux boolean was removed and replaced with ``ondemand_use_ssh``
that is enabled by default.

The ``ondemand_use_kubernetes`` SELinux boolean was added and is disabled by default.

See the :ref:`OnDemand SELinux <ood_selinux>` documentation for details
