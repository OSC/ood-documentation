Upgrading from v2.0
-------------------

Breaking Changes
................


context.json file locations have changed
****************************************

This is an interal item to Open OnDemand and not likely to really affect you at all.

In versions 2.0 and below, batch connect apps wrote a `context.json` file to
a directory like ``~/data/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/<APPNAME>/context.json``.
OnDemand uses these files to cache the choices a user makes for the next time they
use that app.

Version 2.1 now writes files like ``~/ondemand/data/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/cache/<APPNAME>.json``

Details
-------

EL9, Ubuntu 22.04 and Ubuntu 20.04 packages
...........................................

See :ref:`Install Software <install-software>` for instructions on how to install OnDemand using the new EL9, Ubuntu 22.04 and Ubuntu 20.04 packages.

Dex behind Apache reverse proxy by default
..........................................

  .. warning::

     Dex behind the Apache reverse proxy is a behavior change from OnDemand 2.0 where the reverse proxy configuration was optional.
     This is to improve security as well as allow Apache to provide access logs.
     If you have opened ports for Dex they can be closed as all traffic to Dex will flow through Apache.

By default Dex now sits behind the Apache reverse proxy.
If you wish to go back to Dex being directly accessed set the following in :file:`/etc/ood/config/ood_portal.yml`:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      dex_uri: false

Dependency updates
..................

This release updates the following dependencies:

- Ruby 3.0

  .. warning:: The change in Ruby version means any Ruby based apps that are not provided by the OnDemand RPM must be rebuilt or supply their own ``bin/ruby`` to use the older version of ruby.

  .. note:: Ruby 2.7 is still supported and used by Ubuntu 20.04.

- NodeJS 14

  .. warning:: The change in Node version means any Node based apps that are not provided by the OnDemand RPM must be rebuilt.

- Passenger 6.0.14
- NGINX 1.20.2
- ondemand-dex 2.32.0
- OnDemand package now depends on Python 3 instead of Python 2

SELinux changes
...............

The ``ondemand_use_shell_app`` SELinux boolean was removed and replaced with ``ondemand_use_ssh``
that is enabled by default.

The ``ondemand_use_kubernetes`` SELinux boolean was added and is disabled by default.

See the :ref:`OnDemand SELinux <ood_selinux>` documentation for details
