Disabling Users
---------------

You can use the :ref:`nginx stage configuration for disabling users <disabled_shell>`
to disable access to specific users based on the users' default ``shell``.

For example you could disable access to Open OnDemand for any user with the ``/usr/bin/false``
default shell.
