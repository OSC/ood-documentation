Dashboard App
=============

   Example of the Dashboard after a fresh install.

This Open OnDemand application provides a web-interface for launching the
various other Open OnDemand applications. It also provides links for managing
the session of the logged in user. This application is built with the `Ruby on
Rails`_ web application framework.

Usage
-----

This app is deployed on the OnDemand Server under the following path on the
local file system::

  /var/www/ood/apps/sys/dashboard

and can be accessed with the following browser request:

.. http:get:: /pun/sys/dashboard

   Launches the Dashboard App.

How it Works
------------

Requirements needed for the Dashboard App to work on your local HPC network:

- OnDemand Server
- Shared File System

   infrastructure.

:numref:`dashboard-diagram` details how the Dashboard App works on the local
HPC system. The user's PUN running on the OnDemand Server launches the Ruby on
Rails Dashboard app through Passenger_ as the user.

The Dashboard app scans the deployment locations on the local and shared file
systems for other Open OnDemand web applications. In particular it looks for a
`manifest.yml` under the application's root directory that describes how the
Dashboard should advertise the application. The Dashboard will then dynamically
construct its navigation menus based around these discovered applications.

.. note::

   Web applications that are protected by file system permissions will not show
   up in the Dashboard navigation menus if the current user does not have
   access to these files.


Add shortcuts to Files menu
---------------------------

The Files menu by default has a single link to open the Files app in the user's
Home Directory. More links can be added to this menu, for Scratch space and
Project space directories.

Adding more links currently requires adding a custom initializer to the
Dashboard app. Ruby code is placed in the initializer to add one or more Ruby
``Pathname`` objects to the ``OodFilesApp.candidate_favorite_paths`` array, a
global attribute that is used in the Dashboard app.

Start by creating the file
:file:`/etc/ood/config/apps/dashboard/initializers/ood.rb` as such:

.. code-block:: ruby

   # /etc/ood/config/apps/dashboard/initializers/ood.rb

   OodFilesApp.candidate_favorite_paths.tap do |paths|
     # add project space directories
     projects = User.new.groups.map(&:name).grep(/^P./)
     paths.concat projects.map { |p| Pathname.new("/fs/project/#{p}")  }

     # add scratch space directories
     paths << Pathname.new("/fs/scratch/#{User.new.name}")
     paths.concat projects.map { |p| Pathname.new("/fs/scratch/#{p}")  }
   end

- The variable ``paths`` is an array of ``Pathname`` objects that define a list
  of what will appear in the Dashboard menu for Files
- At OSC, the pattern for project paths follows
  :file:`/fs/project/{project_name}`. So above we:

  #. get an array of all user's groups by name
  #. filter that array for groups that start with ``P`` (i.e., ``PZS0002``,
     ``PAW0003``, ...)
  #. using ``map`` we turn this array into an array of ``Pathname`` objects to
     all the possible project directories the user could have.
  #. extend the paths array with this list of paths

- For possible scratch space directories, we look for either
  :file:`/fs/scratch/{project_name}` or :file:`/fs/scratch/{user_name}`

On each request, the Dashboard will check for the existence of the directories
in ``OodFilesApp.candidate_favorite_paths`` array and whichever directories
exist and the user has access to will appear as links in the Files menu under
the Home Directory link.

- Changes to the initializer shouldn't require a rebuilding of the dashboard
  assets or reinstalling dependencies, but to see the change it does require a
  Dashboard app restart, which can be forced from the Dashboard itself by
  selecting *Help* â†’ *Restart Web Server* from the top right menu.

If you access the Dashboard, and it crashes, then you may have made a mistake
in ``ood.rb`` file, whose code is run during the initialization of the Rails
app.
