   Example of the Active Jobs App displaying all jobs submitted to the
   clusters.

This Open OnDemand application provides a web-based view of the current status
of all the available jobs on the batch servers hosted by the HPC center. This
application is built with the `Ruby on Rails`_ web application framework.

The Active Jobs App displays all the available jobs in a dynamically searchable
and sortable table. The user can search on job id, job name, job owner, charged
account, status of job, as well as the cluster the job was submitted to.
Progressive disclosure is used to show further details on individual jobs by
clicking in the "right arrow" to the left of a table row.

Usage
-----

This app is deployed on the OnDemand Server under the following path on the
local file system::

  /var/www/ood/apps/sys/activejobs

and can be accessed with the following browser request:

.. http:get:: /pun/sys/activejobs

   Launches the Active Jobs App with a table of available jobs.

How it Works
------------

Requirements needed for the Active Jobs App to work on your local HPC network:

- OnDemand Server
- Resource Manager Server (e.g., Torque/PBS Batch Server)

   Diagram detailing how the Active Jobs App interacts with the HPC
   infrastructure.

:numref:`active-jobs-diagram` details how the Active Jobs App works on a local
HPC system. The user's PUN running on the OnDemand Server launches the Ruby on
Rails Active Jobs app through Passenger_ as the user. The Active Jobs app then
retrieves a list of available jobs from the resource manager server through
either a library call or forking a binary such as ``qstat`` and parsing the
output.
