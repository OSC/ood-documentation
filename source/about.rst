What is Open OnDemand
=====================

The Open OnDemand Project [1]_ is an NSF-funded [2]_ open-source HPC portal based on
the `Ohio Supercomputer Center's <osc_>`_ original OnDemand portal. The goal of
Open OnDemand is to provide an easy way for system administrators to provide
web access to their HPC resources.
