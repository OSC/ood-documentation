Add Cluster Configuration Files
===============================

**(Optional, but recommended)**

The following apps do not require a cluster configuration file:

- :ref:`dashboard`
- :ref:`files`
- :ref:`shell` (but only launched from within the Files App)

The following apps do require a cluster configuration file:

- :ref:`shell` (connect to a cluster login node from the Dashboard App)
- :ref:`active-jobs` (view a list of active jobs for the various clusters)
- :ref:`job-composer` (submit jobs to various clusters)

#. Create the default directory that the cluster configuration files reside
   under:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ sudo mkdir -p /etc/ood/config/clusters.d

#. Create a cluster YAML configuration file for each HPC cluster you want to
   provide access to. They must have the ``*.yml`` extension.

   .. note::

      It is best to name the file after the HPC cluster it is defining. For
      example, we added the cluster configuration file
      :file:`/etc/ood/config/clusters.d/oakley.yml` for the Oakley cluster here
      at OSC.

   The *simplest* cluster configuration file for an HPC cluster with only a login
   node and **no resource manager** looks like:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      # /etc/ood/config/clusters.d/my_cluster.yml
      ---
      v2:
        metadata:
          title: "My Cluster"
        login:
          host: "my_cluster.my_center.edu"

   Where ``host`` is the SSH server host for the given cluster.

   In production you will also want to add a resource manager. That is because the
   :ref:`active-jobs` and the :ref:`job-composer` won't be able to list or submit
   jobs without a defined resource manager.
