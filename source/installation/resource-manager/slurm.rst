Configure Slurm
===============

A YAML cluster configuration file for a Slurm resource manager on an HPC
cluster looks like:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 8-

   # /etc/ood/config/clusters.d/my_cluster.yml
   ---
   v2:
     metadata:
       title: "My Cluster"
     login:
       host: "my_cluster.my_center.edu"
     job:
       adapter: "slurm"
       cluster: "my_cluster"
       bin: "/path/to/slurm/bin"
       conf: "/path/to/slurm.conf"
       # bin_overrides:
         # sbatch: "/usr/local/bin/sbatch"
         # squeue: ""
         # scontrol: ""
         # scancel: ""

with the following configuration options:

adapter
  This is set to ``slurm``.
cluster
  The Slurm cluster name. *Optional*, passed to SLURM as ``-M <cluster>``
bin
  The path to the Slurm client installation binaries.
conf
  The path to the Slurm configuration file for this cluster. *Optional*
bin_overrides
  Replacements/wrappers for Slurm's job submission and control clients. *Optional*

  Supports the following clients:

  - `sbatch`
  - `squeue`
  - `scontrol`
  - `scancel`

.. note::

   If you do not have a multi-cluster Slurm setup you can remove the ``cluster:
   "my_cluster"`` line from the above configuration file.

.. tip::

   When installing Slurm ensure that all nodes on your cluster including the node running the Open OnDemand server have the same `MUNGE <https://dun.github.io/munge/>`_ key installed. Read the `Slurm Quick Start Administrator Guide <https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart_admin.html>`_ for more information on installing and configuring Slurm itself.
