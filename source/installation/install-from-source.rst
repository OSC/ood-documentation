Building From Source
====================

Building from source is left as an exercise to the reader. 
     
It's not particularly difficult to build the code, but installing it with all the various files is. Should you be interested, 
review the ``Dockerfile`` and packaging specs for what would be involved.

- https://github.com/OSC/ondemand/tree/master/packaging

If you'd like a package built for a system that we don't currently support, feel free to open a ticket!
