Add Jupyter
===========

This tutorial will walk you through creating an interactive Jupyter app that
your users will use to launch a `Jupyter Notebook Server`_ within a batch job
on a compute node. The user will then be able to connect to the running server
through their browser and take advantage of the resources provided within the
batch job.
