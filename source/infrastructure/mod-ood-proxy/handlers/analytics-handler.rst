analytics_handler
=================

This handler submits an HTTP request using the `Google Analytics Measurement
Protocol`_ with data accumulated by the user page request. It only submits the
data if the user is authenticated and mapped to a local user name.

It is recommended that this handler be included under the ``/pun`` location
only. So an example Apache configuration file may look like:

.. code-block:: apache

   <Location "/pun">
     ...

     SetEnv OOD_ANALYTICS_TRACKING_URL "http://www.google-analytics.com/collect"
     SetEnv OOD_ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID  "UA-XXXXXXXX-X"
     LuaHookLog analytics.lua analytics_handler
   </Location>

This handler is called in the ``LuaHookLog`` phase of the request-response
lifecycle. This occurs after the client has received the response so it does
not affect page load time for the client.

.. note::

   Please contact us if you'd like to enable this feature and have access to
   it. This will require us to generate a new Property ID for your center that
   we can then share with you.

Configuration
-------------

Configuration is handled by setting CGI environment variables within the Apache
configuration file with the following format:

.. code-block:: apache

   SetEnv ARG_FOR_LUA "value of argument"

.. envvar:: OOD_ANALYTICS_TRACKING_URL

   The `Google Analytics Measurement Protocol`_ URL that this handler submits
   the data to. Recommended value is
   ``http://www.google-analytics.com/collect``.

.. envvar:: OOD_ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID

   The Tracking ID / Property ID assigned by Google Analytics that contains the
   appropriate custom dimensions and metrics.
