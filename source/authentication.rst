Authentication
==============

Open OnDemand supports most authentication modules that work with Apache HTTP
Server version 2.4. The following :ref:`authentication-overview` section
provides an introduction to setting up these generic authentication modules
with an Open OnDemand installation. Tutorials will also be provided with the
focus on setting up some of the more common authentication modules (e.g.,
OpenID Connect with KeyCloak).

.. note::

   If you managed to install an Apache authentication module at your center
   that currently does not have a tutorial listed below we would greatly
   appreciate it if you could take the time to contribute a detailed
   walkthrough.
