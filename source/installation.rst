Installation
============

The OnDemand host machine needs to be setup *similarly* to a login node. This
means that it will need:

- RedHat/CentOS 7+
- a common user/group database, e.g., LDAP + NSS
- a common host file list
- the resource manager (e.g., Torque, Slurm, or LSF) client binaries and
  libraries used by the batch servers installed
- configuration on both OnDemand node **and batch servers** to be able to
  submit, status, and delete jobs from command line
- signed SSL certificate with corresponding intermediate certificate for your
  advertised OnDemand host name (e.g., ``ondemand.my_center.edu``)
- your LDAP URL, base DN, and attribute to search for (in some rare cases a
  bind DN and corresponding bind password)
