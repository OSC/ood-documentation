Customization
=============

Open OnDemand allows for a great deal of customization.

The Overiew section covers where customization files are stored 
on the system and how Open OnDemand uses these files. 

The Customizations section provides many environment variables and 
file locations that can be used to allow for changes to the look and functioning of 
Open OnDemand.
