User Form
=========

The configuration file ``form.yml`` is responsible for:

- defining all the attributes used throughout the various ERB files (defined as
  the session context) that make up the Interactive App
- setting the HTML form input or hard-coded value of each attribute
- designating a cluster to submit the batch job to

It is located in the root of the application directory.

Assuming we already have a sandbox Interactive App deployed under::

  ${HOME}/ondemand/dev/my_app

The ``form.yml`` configuration file can be found at::

  ${HOME}/ondemand/dev/my_app/form.yml

Then in the browser, navigate to the :ref:`dashboard` and choose in the top
right menu: *Develop* â†’ *My Sandbox Apps (Development)*. Finally click *Launch
My App* from the list of sandbox apps.


You should now see the HTML form used to gather the user-defined attributes for
building and launching the ``my_app`` Interactive App session.

.. tip::

   You can include dynamically generated content in the form by renaming the
   form file to ``form.yml.erb`` and incorporating ERB syntax.

Configuration
-------------

.. describe:: cluster (String)

     the cluster id that the Interactive App session is submitted to

     .. warning::

        The cluster id must correspond to a cluster configuration file located
        under::

          /etc/ood/config/clusters.d

.. describe:: form (Array<String>)

     a list of **all** the attributes that will be used as the context for
     describing an Interactive App session

     .. note::

        The attributes that appear as HTML form elements will appear to the
        user in the order they are listed in this configuration option.

.. describe:: attributes (Hash)

     the object defining the hard-coded value or HTML form element used for the
     various custom attributes

Attributes
----------

Attributes are *variables* whose values can be set either by the user from
within an HTML form or hard-coded to a specific value in the form
configuration. These attributes and their corresponding values are then made
available to the Interactive App through its intermediate steps:
:ref:`app-development-interactive-template` and
:ref:`app-development-interactive-submit`.

.. _app-development-interactive-form-predefined-attributes:

Predefined Attributes
``````````````````````

The Dashboard that supports these plugins provides the plugins with some useful
predefined attributes that can be included in the ``form:`` configuration list
with very little or no modification on the part of the developer.

So a very simple ``form.yml`` that requests the user input a queue followed by
an account to submit the batch job (interactive session) to, and then
subsequently submits the job to that queue without any customization on the
part of the app developer can look like:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # ${HOME}/ondemand/dev/my_app/form.yml
   ---
   cluster: 
     - "owens"
     - "pitzer"
   form:
     - bc_queue
     - bc_account

The most commonly used predefined attributes are given as:

cluster
  This adds a ``select`` to the HTML form that will allow the user to select 
  what cluster they want to submit the job.

  If there is only one cluster set in ``form.yml``, the select box will not
  be added and the job will be sent to the specified cluster.

bc_account
  This adds a ``text_field`` to the HTML form that will be used as the charged
  account for the submitted job.

  This attribute gets directly set on `OodCore::Job::Script#accounting_id`_.

bc_queue
  This adds a ``text_field`` to the HTML form that will supply the name of the
  queue that the batch job is submitted to.

  This attribute gets directly set on `OodCore::Job::Script#queue_name`_.

bc_num_hours
  This adds a ``number_field`` to the HTML form that describes the maximum
  amount of hours the submitted batch job may run.

  This attribute gets converted to seconds and then set on
  `OodCore::Job::Script#wall_time`_.

bc_num_slots
  This adds a ``number_field`` to the HTML form that describes the number of
  processors, CPUs on a single node, or nodes that the submitted job may use
  (depends on the resource manager used, e.g., Torque, Slurm, ...).

  This attribute manipulates the brittle `OodCore::Job::Script#native`_ field
  with a value that depends on the given resource manager for the cluster.

  .. warning::

     This predefined attribute is very resource manager specific, and is the
     most brittle of all the other predefined attributes. May require
     customization (see
     :ref:`interactive-development-form-customizing-attributes`) to work at
     your center.

bc_email_on_started
  This adds a ``check_box`` to the HTML form that determines whether the user
  should be notified by email when the batch job starts.

  This attribute sets value of `OodCore::Job::Script#email_on_started`_
  depending on whether the user checked the box or not.

.. _interactive-development-form-customizing-attributes:

Customizing Attributes
``````````````````````

For each defined attribute in the ``form:`` configuration option, you can
modify/override any component that makes up the HTML form element in the
``attributes:`` configuration option, e.g.:

.. code-block:: yaml

   attributes:
     my_custom_attribute:
       label: "My custom label"
       ...

The available configuration options that can be modified for a given attribute
are:

.. describe:: widget (String, null)

     the type of HTML form element to use for input

     - ``text_field``
     - ``text_area``
     - ``number_field`` - can use ``min``, ``max``, ``step``
     - ``check_box``
     - ``select`` - can use ``options``
     - ``hidden_field``
     - ``resolution_field`` (used for specifying resolution dimensions
       necessary for VNC)

     Some other fields that have varying support across different browsers
     include: ``range_field``, ``date_field``, ``search_field``,
     ``email_field``, ``telephone_field``, ``url_field``, ``password_field``.

     Default
       Accepts any text

       .. code-block:: yaml

          widget: "text_field"

     Example
       Accepts only numbers

       .. code-block:: yaml

          widget: "number_field"

.. describe:: value (String, null)

     the default value used for the input field

     Default
       None

       .. code-block:: yaml

          value: ""

     Example
       Set default value of 5

       .. code-block:: yaml

          value: "5"

     .. warning::

        Values get cached so that users do not need to repeat previous session
        submissions. So this default value will only appear for the user if
        they have no cached value.

.. describe:: label (String, null)

     the label displayed above the input field

     Default
       Uses the name of the attribute

     Example
       Better describe the attribute

       .. code-block:: yaml

          label: "Number of nodes"

.. describe:: required (Boolean, null)

     whether this field must be filled out before submitting the form

     Default
       Not required by default

       .. code-block:: yaml

          required: false

     Example
       Make field required

       .. code-block:: yaml

          required: true

.. describe:: help (String, null)

     help text that appears below the field (can be written in Markdown_)

     Default
       No help text appears below input field

       .. code-block:: yaml

          help: null

     Example
       Leave a long descriptive help message using Markdown_

       .. code-block:: yaml

          help: |
            Please fill in this field with **one** of the following
            options:

            - `red`
            - `blue`
            - `green`

.. describe:: pattern (String, null)

     a regular expression that the control's value is checked against (only
     applies to widgets: ``text_field``, ``search_field``, ``telephone_field``,
     ``url_field``, ``email_field``, ``password_field``)

     Default
       No pattern

       .. code-block:: yaml

          pattern: null

     Example
       Only accept three letter country codes

       .. code-block:: yaml

          pattern: "[A-Za-z]{3}"

.. describe:: min (Integer, null)

     specifies minimum value for this item, which must not be greater than its
     maximum value (only applies to widget: ``number_field``)

     Default
       No minimum value

       .. code-block:: yaml

          min: null

     Example
       Set minimum value of 5

       .. code-block:: yaml

          min: 5

.. describe:: max (Integer, null)

     specifies maximum value for this item, which must not be less than its
     minimum value (only applies to widget: ``number_field``)

     Default
       No maximum value

       .. code-block:: yaml

          min: null

     Example
       Set maximum value of 15

       .. code-block:: yaml

          min: 15

.. describe:: step (Integer, null)

     works with ``min`` and ``max`` options to limit the increments at which a
     value can be set, it can be the string ``"any"`` or positive floating
     point number (only applies to widget: ``number_field``)

     Default
       No step size

       .. code-block:: yaml

          step: null

     Example
       Only accept integer values

       .. code-block:: yaml

          step: 1

.. describe:: options (Array<Array<String>>, null)

     a list of options for the ``select`` widget

     Default
       No options are supplied

       .. code-block:: yaml

          options: []

     Example
       Provide a list of cars

       .. code-block:: yaml

          options:
            - ["Volvo", "volvo"]
            - ["Ford", "ford"]
            - ["Toyota", "toyota"]

     .. note::

        Typically the options are given as a list of pairs. The first string in
        the pair is the option text and the second string in the pair is the
        option value.

        The user will see a list of options "Volvo", "Ford", and "Toyota" to
        choose from in the HTML form, but the backend will process a value of
        either "volvo", "ford", or "toyota" depending on what the user chose.

Examples
--------

The simplest example consists of only a cluster id

.. code-block:: yaml

   # ${HOME}/ondemand/dev/my_app/form.yml
   ---
   cluster: "owens"

where we expect the Interactive App session to be submitted with the following
cluster configuration file::

  /etc/ood/config/clusters.d/owens.yml

After modifying the ``form.yml`` click *Launch My App* from the Dashboard
sandbox app list and you should be presented with **ONLY** a Launch button,
since we didn't define ``form:`` or ``attributes:``.

User-defined Attributes
```````````````````````

The following configuration file

.. code-block:: yaml

   # ${HOME}/ondemand/dev/my_app/form.yml
   ---
   cluster: "owens"
   form:
     - my_module_version

defines a session context attribute called ``my_module_version``.

After modifying the ``form.yml`` click *Launch My App* from the Dashboard
sandbox app list and you will see an empty text box with the label "My Module
Version". The user can input any value here and launch the Interactive App
session. This value will be made available to the batch job script and
submission parameters that are discussed in a later section.

Hard-coded Attributes
`````````````````````

The following configuration file

.. code-block:: yaml

   # ${HOME}/ondemand/dev/my_app/form.yml
   ---
   cluster: "owens"
   form:
     - my_module_version
   attributes:
     my_module_version: "2.2.0"

does two things:

- it defines a context attribute called ``my_module_version`` in the ``form:``
  configuration option
- it then sets the value of ``my_module_version`` to ``"2.2.0"`` in the
  ``attributes:`` configuration option to later be used when defining the batch
  job script and/or submission parameters

The user will now **ONLY** be presented with a Launch button in the HTML form
because the attribute ``my_module_version`` is hard-coded, so there is no need
for a input text box.

Customize User-defined Attributes
`````````````````````````````````

The following configuration file

.. code-block:: yaml

   # ${HOME}/ondemand/dev/my_app/form.yml
   ---
   cluster: "owens"
   form:
     - my_module_version
   attributes:
     my_module_version:
       widget: "number_field"
       label: "Module version #"
       required: true
       help: "Please input a version number between 1-10"
       min: 1
       max: 11
       step: 1

does two things:

- it defines a context attribute called ``my_module_version`` in the ``form:``
  configuration option
- it then describes the HTML form element to use for the ``my_module_version``
  attribute
