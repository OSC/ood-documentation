Modify Cluster Configuration
============================

If you haven't already done so, you will need to first have a corresponding
cluster configuration file for the cluster you intend to submit
:ref:`interactive` batch jobs to. It is recommended you follow the directions
on :ref:`add-cluster-config`.

Modify the cluster configuration file with the necessary information so that
a batch script generated from an interactive app can find the installed
copies of `TurboVNC`_ and `websockify`_:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 11-

   # /etc/ood/config/clusters.d/my_cluster.yml
   ---
   v2:
     metadata:
       title: "Cluster 1"
     login:
       host: "my_cluster.my_center.edu"
     job:
       adapter: "..."
       ...
     batch_connect:
       basic:
         script_wrapper: |
           module purge
           %s
       vnc:
         script_wrapper: |
           module purge
           export PATH="/usr/local/turbovnc/bin:$PATH"
           export WEBSOCKIFY_CMD="/usr/local/websockify/run"
           %s

where we introduced the configuration option ``batch_connect`` that allows us
to add global settings for both a ``basic`` interactive web server as well as a
``vnc`` interactive web server.

In the above case we modify the global setting ``script_wrapper`` for both
``basic`` and ``vnc`` sessions. This allows us to supply :command:`bash` code
that wraps around the body of the template script (specified by ``%s``). First,
we purge the module environment to remove any conflicting modules that may have
been loaded by the user's ``.bashrc`` or ``.bash_profile`` files. Then we
specify the required environment needed by the ``vnc`` script to launch
`TurboVNC`_ and `websockify`_.

.. note::

   You will most likely need to replace the block of code below in your cluster
   configuration file:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      script_wrapper: |
        module purge
        export PATH="/usr/local/turbovnc/bin:$PATH"
        export WEBSOCKIFY_CMD="/usr/local/websockify/run"
        %s

   with a block that adds the full path to the TurboVNC binaries into the
   ``PATH`` environment variable as well as the corresponding websockify
   launcher into the ``WEBSOCKIFY_CMD`` environment variable.

.. warning::

   Do not forget to include the ``%s`` in the ``script_wrapper`` configuration
   option. Otherwise the actual :command:`bash` code that launches the
   corresponding web servers will never be interpolated into the main batch
   script and run.
